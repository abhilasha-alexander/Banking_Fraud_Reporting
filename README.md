# Banking_Fraud_Reporting
This is a visualisation project identifying insights from Banking Fraud data. Contains data from Kaggle with a python file to cleanup and derive location data.
Source file is transaction_data.csv
Python code was written to derive location from the geolocation coordinates. Country name was later derived using basic excel functions. Transalations were dealt with using google translate.
